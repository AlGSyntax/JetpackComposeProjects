# Mono-Repo for To-Do App, Weather App, and Daily News App

## üöß Work in Progress üöß

Welcome to the **Mono-Repo** for my three ongoing projects:
- **To-Do App**: A simple task management app built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
- **Weather App**: A basic structure for a weather forecasting app.
- **Daily News App**: A skeleton for a news aggregation app.

### ‚ùóÔ∏è Disclaimer: Primordial README

This README is still in its **primitive** form and serves as a **basic placeholder** for now. I plan to expand and improve it as the projects evolve. For now, it will briefly describe the three ongoing apps and the repo structure. **Think of this as a work-in-progress guide** ‚Äì more detailed documentation will be added soon.

### To-Do App (WIP)
The To-Do app is built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. It allows users to manage tasks with basic CRUD functionality.

### Weather App (WIP)
The Weather App currently contains the basic project structure for integrating weather APIs and UI components for displaying weather data.

### Daily News App (WIP)
The Daily News App is a skeleton project for aggregating and displaying daily news articles.

## Future Enhancements
- **Detailed Documentation**: Each project will have its own dedicated section with instructions for setup, usage, and contributing.
- **Feature List**: A more detailed breakdown of each app's functionality will be added.
- **API Integration**: Information on APIs used in the Weather and Daily News apps will be documented.
- **Screenshots and Diagrams**: To provide better visualization of the app structures.

Stay tuned as I continue to update this repository with more information and features. Thanks for your patience!

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome once the primary structure is complete. For now, the code is in its early stages, so feel free to explore, but please be aware that the project is under heavy development.
